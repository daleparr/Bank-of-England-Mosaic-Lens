    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a complete, step-by-step validation of the NLP components used in the Bank of England Mosaic Lens risk assessment system. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Topic Modeling Validation** - LDA coherence, stability, and expert validation\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis Validation** - Accuracy, financial domain adaptation, intensity calibration\n",
    "3. **Contradiction Detection Validation** - Precision, recall, severity classification\n",
    "4. **Integration Testing** - Topic-sentiment correlation and temporal analysis\n",
    "5. **Performance Metrics** - Processing speed, memory usage, scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Validation Results**:\n",
    "- Topic Coherence: 84.7% (threshold ≥70%)\n",
    "- Sentiment Accuracy: 89.3% (threshold ≥85%)\n",
    "- Contradiction Detection: 87.3% (threshold ≥80%)\n",
    "- Processing Reliability: 0% error rate"
