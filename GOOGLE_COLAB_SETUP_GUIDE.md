**Key Components**:
- Financial sentiment lexicon (58 terms)
- Topic classification keywords (5 categories)
- Stop words list

```python
# Copy the entire contents of colab_cell_2_lexicons.py here
```

#### Cell 3: Validation Data Generation
**File**: `colab_cell_3_data_generation.py`
**Purpose**: Generate synthetic financial documents with known ground truth
**Output**: 15 financial documents with topic and sentiment labels

```python
# Copy the entire contents of colab_cell_3_data_generation.py here
```

#### Cell 4: Text Preprocessing Functions
**File**: `colab_cell_4_preprocessing.py`
**Purpose**: Text preprocessing and topic classification functions
**Key Functions**:
- `preprocess_text()`: Basic text cleaning and tokenization
- `classify_topic()`: Keyword-based topic classification

```python
# Copy the entire contents of colab_cell_4_preprocessing.py here
```

#### Cell 5: Sentiment Analysis Functions
**File**: `colab_cell_5_sentiment_analysis.py`
**Purpose**: Financial domain-adapted sentiment analysis
**Key Features**:
- Financial lexicon-based scoring
- Context weighting for financial terms
- Sentiment classification (positive/negative/neutral)

```python
# Copy the entire contents of colab_cell_5_sentiment_analysis.py here
```

#### Cell 6: Contradiction Detection
**File**: `colab_cell_6_contradiction_detection.py`
**Purpose**: Detect contradictions between positive language and negative indicators
**Method**: Sentence-level sentiment analysis with opposition detection

```python
# Copy the entire contents of colab_cell_6_contradiction_detection.py here
```

#### Cell 7: Validation and Metrics Calculation
**File**: `colab_cell_7_validation_metrics.py`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of NLP components
**Metrics**:
- Topic classification accuracy
- Sentiment analysis accuracy
- Per-component performance breakdown

```python
# Copy the entire contents of colab_cell_7_validation_metrics.py here
```

#### Cell 8: Comprehensive Validation Report
**File**: `colab_cell_8_final_report.py`
**Purpose**: Generate final validation report for Bank of England review
**Output**: Complete compliance assessment and recommendations

```python
# Copy the entire contents of colab_cell_8_final_report.py here
```

## Execution Instructions

### Sequential Execution
1. **Run Cell 1**: Setup and imports
2. **Run Cell 2**: Load lexicons and dictionaries
3. **Run Cell 3**: Generate validation dataset
4. **Run Cell 4**: Test preprocessing and topic classification
5. **Run Cell 5**: Test sentiment analysis
6. **Run Cell 6**: Test contradiction detection
7. **Run Cell 7**: Run comprehensive validation
8. **Run Cell 8**: Generate final report

### Expected Runtime
- **Total execution time**: < 1 second
- **Memory usage**: Minimal (< 50MB)
- **Dependencies**: Core Python only

## Validation Results

### Expected Output Metrics
- **Topic Classification Accuracy**: ~93% (threshold: ≥70%)
- **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy**: ~73% (threshold: ≥80%)
- **Contradiction Detection Accuracy**: ~75% (threshold: ≥75%)
- **Overall Status**: Needs improvement (sentiment analysis below threshold)

### Key Validation Points for Bank of England Review

#### 1. **Code Transparency**
- All algorithms use basic Python operations
- No "black box" machine learning models
- Complete audit trail of calculations

#### 2. **Financial Domain Adaptation**
- Specialized lexicon for banking terminology
- Context-aware sentiment weighting
- Industry-specific topic categories

#### 3. **Methodology Validation**
- Ground truth comparison with known labels
- Statistical significance testing
- Performance benchmarking against thresholds

#### 4. **Regulatory Compliance**
- Documented methodology
- Reproducible results
- Clear pass/fail criteria

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Import Errors
**Problem**: Module not found errors
**Solution**: This workflow uses only core Python libraries. No pip installs required.
