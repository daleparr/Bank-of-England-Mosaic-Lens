### 3. Advanced NLP Pipeline Design

#### Topic Modeling Strategy
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines seed-based classification with BERTopic emergent discovery
- **8 Core Risk Categories**: Credit, operational, market, regulatory, macroeconomic, climate, digital transformation, and geopolitical risks
- **Statistical Validation**: Coherence scoring, significance testing, and noise reduction
- **Cross-Bank Validation**: Signals must appear across multiple institutions

#### Sentiment Analysis Framework
- **Multi-Layered Analysis**: FinBERT sentiment + tone analysis + risk-specific features

- **Temporal Tracking**: Sentiment momentum and regime change detection
- **Risk-Specific Lexicons**: Financial hedging, uncertainty, and escalation language

### 4. Statistical Significance Framework

#### Anomaly Detection
- **Multi-Method Approach**: Isolation Forest, change point detection, statistical outliers
- **Cross-Bank Correlation**: Identify systemic vs. idiosyncratic risks
- **Effect Size Requirements**: Minimum Cohen's w = 0.3 for medium effect
- **False Discovery Rate Control**: Bonferroni correction for multiple testing

#### Risk Scoring
- **Composite Scoring**: Combines prevalence anomalies, sentiment shifts, and cross-bank correlations
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical uncertainty quantification
- **Temporal Persistence**: Signals must persist across quarters
- **Explainability**: SHAP values for feature importance
